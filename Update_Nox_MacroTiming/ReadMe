This is a simple program that will read the Nox Macros you have recorded and offer to take the most recent one
you have created and change the timing to be as fast as possible.

So it is best to record a fresh macro, make your clicks and save it.

Then run this program, hit OK, then try the macro again.  

It should now be super human speed! :)
