This is a beta release for testing on different users and resolutions.

If feedback is good and popularity demands;
next release will clean up the code so there are no erronious readings when not in battle.

It will also get configuraion options so you can manually overide for perfect setup if auto calculations are off

Last I will find a way to make it work on MeMU as well.

Please post feedback on the Reddit Thread linking here.

Thanks!
