This is a beta release for testing on different users and resolutions.

If feedback is good and popularity demands;
next release will clean up the code so there are no erronious readings when not in battle.

It will also get configuraion options so you can manually overide for perfect setup if auto calculations are off

Last I will find a way to make it work on MeMU as well.

Change Log:
Beta v2
Made the actual window smaller to take up less space, while making the number readout bigger and bolder.
Added a 2nd checking point that will help determin if you are in a battle or not.  
This will help avoid seeing HP readings from anything on screen when not in battle.
